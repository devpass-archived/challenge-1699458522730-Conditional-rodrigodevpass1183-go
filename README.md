## Conditional Expressions Challenge
In this challenge, we're exploring conditional expressions in Go. Your task is to implement a function called `Max` that takes two integers as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using a conditional expression (`if-else`). Finally, call the `Max` function and print the maximum number.
